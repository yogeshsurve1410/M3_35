# RKE (Remote Keyless Entry)
 
A smart entry system is an electronic lock that controls access to a building or vehicle without using a traditional mechanical key.
The term keyless entry system originally meant a lock controlled by a keypad located at or near the driver's door,
which required entering a predetermined (or self-programmed) numeric code.
Such systems now have a hidden touch-activated keypad and are still available on certain Ford and Lincoln models.The term remote keyless system (RKS),also called keyless entry or remote central locking,refers to a lock that uses an electronic remote control as a key which is activated by a handheld device or automatically by proximity.
Widely used in automobiles, an RKS performs the functions of a standard car key without physical contact. When within a few yards of the car, pressing a button on the remote can lock or unlock the doors, and may perform other functions.
A remote keyless system can include both a remote keyless entry system (RKE), which unlocks the doors, and a remote keyless ignition system (RKI), which starts the engine.
Remote keyless entry (RKE) system is a system designed to remotely lock or unlock access to automobiles. 


RKE transmission requires two components - a transmitter and a receiver. 
*	Transmitter - RKE key fob, other ID device with RKE integrated 
*	Receiver - Body Control ECU, other ECU with integrated RKE 
RKE operates by broadcasting radio waves on a particular frequency unidirectionally. 
RKE systems implement encryption and rolling code algorithms to prevent car thieves from intercepting and spoofing the telegrams. 
Typical RKE functions are: 
*	Print lock â€“ (Blue switch on- All led on at the same time)
*	Print unlock - (Blue switch press two times- All led off at the same time)
*	Print alarm activation/deactivation - (Blue switch press three times- All led on in clockwise manner)
*	Print approach light - (Blue switch press four times- All led on in anti-clockwise manner)
